# Exercise 07 - Exchanging messages between Event Broker Services (Dynamic Message Routing)

In the SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh instance that we are using for this event has more than one event broker service but so far we've only published and consumed messages within a single event broker service. In this exercise we will learn about Dynamic Message Routing and we will see messages being exchanged between brokers.

## Dynamic Message Routing

Dynamic Message Routing is the underlying technology enabling message exchange between different event broker services in an event mesh.
