This page intends to capture common problems that you might face while going through the exercises part of the CodeJam. 

## SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh

- #### The event broker services are not listed/visible in Cluster Manager
  
  By default the Cluster Manager will only show the event broker services that you have created. If you are not seeing the event broker services that you expect, you might have the `Only show my service` checkbox checked.

  <!-- TODO: Highlight the checkbox -->
  <p align = "center">
    <img alt="Cluster Manager - Only show my services, unchecked" src="assets/troubleshoot-event-broker-services-visible.png" width="50%"/><br/>
    <i>Cluster Manager - Only show my services, unchecked</i>
  </p>

  Solution:
  - Uncheck the `Only show my service` checkbox in the Cluster Manager
