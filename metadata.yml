  In this SAP CodeJam, we will look at [SAP Integration Suite, advanced event mesh](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/serviceCatalog/advanced-event-mesh?service_plan=default&region=all&commercialModel=cloud) and how we can use them to enable event-driven architecture and scenarios across multiple systems and services in our landscape.

  > The full contents of this generated EPUB can found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SAP-samples/event-driven-integrations-codejam).

  By the end of the CodeJam, we will achieve a scenario like the one below in the diagram.
