# Exercise 01 - Events in the SAP Ecosystem

Before we start exchanging events between our systems, let's get familiar with the events that SAP applications can produce. In the SAP Business Accelerator Hub, you can discover, explore, and test the different types of content available for SAP products, as well as third-party products. The content available here can be used to accelerate the development of integrations and extensions required at your company. 

At the end of this exercise, you'll have an understanding of the SAP Business Accelerator Hub, the different SAP products that can generate events and the different types of events that you will be able to find in it.

ðŸ‘‰ Navigate to the SAP Business Accelerator Hub (https://hub.sap.com) and select the [Events category](https://hub.sap.com/content-type/Events/events/events) to list all the events produced by different SAP applications.
