# Optional Exercise 01 - Configuring a Message VPN Bridge

In a previous exercise we discussed Dynamic Message Routing (DMR) and how it enables message exchange between different event broker services (nodes) in an event mesh. An alternative to using DMR is a Message VPN Bridge. This is what we are going to explore in this exercise.

## Message VPN Bridge

A Message VPN Bridge is a static configuration that allows you to define a connection between two event broker services. In a Message VPN, you need to configure topic subscriptions to define which events are exchanged between the brokers. This is useful when you want to control the message flow between two event broker services, for example, to restrict the flow of messages between two event broker services.

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.
